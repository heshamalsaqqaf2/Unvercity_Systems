## Introduction

Introduction to Class Diagram
A Class Diagram is a type of structural diagram used in the Unified Modelling Language [`UML`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language) This type of diagram focuses on the visualization of objects (Classes) and the connections between them, such as Inheritance or Aggregation. The diagram represents the system's Classes, __`Attributes`__, and __`Methods`__, as well as the __`Relationships`__ that connect these objects to each other.

## Class Diagram Components

Classes: Represent the basic objects of the system that contain properties and methods:

- __`Attributes`__: These are the values or variables that an object holds.
- __`Methods`__: These are the functions that a class can implement.
- __`Relationships`__: Represent how classes are related to each other.

## Scenario

Imagine that we have a university system to manage the library, students, departments, courses, and fees. The role of the Class Diagram is to show all the classes involved in this system and how they interact with each other. This diagram can be used by developers to understand the relationships between the different components of the system before they start coding.
